# exact — exact-contact solver for packings of unit squares

Input: an approximate packing (text: `n s`, then `x y theta_deg` per square, centres, lower-left origin).
Output: a nearby **exact KKT point** of *min S subject to non-overlap* (`--dps`, default 80; 2000 tested at n = 17), numerical optimality checks, and an
**exact rational certificate** of `s(n) <= S'`, with `S' - S ~ 1e-19`.

Outputs in `results/` (or `--out`): `NAME.log` (report), `NAME.json`, `NAME.exact.txt` (configuration, dps-10 digits),
`NAME.cert` (certificate).  Uses one core (BLAS threads pinned to 1); n = 110 takes ~5 s at 80 digits, n = 300 a few minutes.
Requires python3 with numpy, scipy (HiGHS LP/MILP), mpmath.  The verifiers need only the standard library.

**`batch/`: every record in jlevy's register (n = 1–324), 2026-10-05.**  323 certified (317 numerically KKT local
minima), every n ≤ 291 included; 50 certified values lie 3e-13 … 5e-11 below the register's printed bounds (the exact
optimum of the same packing).  See `batch/README.md`.

**Exact forms and local-minimum certificates (2026-10-07; details and state: `../../tasks/exact-minpoly/README.md`).**
`exactsolve.py` also writes `NAME.contacts.json`, the input for the following tools (run via `./env.sh`):

| tool | does |
|---|---|
| `minpoly.py` | contact graph → number field `K = ℚ[t]/f`, exact configuration over `K`, the minimal polynomial of S and an isolating interval |
| `verify_exact.py` | independent stdlib check of `minpoly.py`'s output: contacts ≡ 0 mod f, the rest separated by interval arithmetic |
| `minpoly/run_minpoly.sh`, `minpoly/summary.py` | batch over the register → `minpoly/results.md` (269/324 verified 10-07) |

## Method

1. **Contacts** (`find_contacts`).  Features: corner *a* of square *j* on side *k* of square *i*
   (`g = n_ik·(P_ja − c_i) − ½ ≥ 0`), corner on wall (`g = Px, S−Px, Py, S−Py`).  An incidence needs |g| < tol, a side
   line that separates the pair (all four corners of *j* outside it) and a corner projecting onto the side.
   Side–side contacts are two incidences (the two ends of the overlap segment; four when exactly aligned).
   Pure **corner–corner** touches (every incidence at a side end or ≤ 1e-4 past it, no side holding two corners: e.g.
   diagonal neighbours in an axis grid) are disjunctive and are set aside from the equations; they are checked by SAT
   afterwards and handled exactly in the MILP test (5).  The tolerance is chosen automatically: the smallest of 1e-9 …
   1e-6 for which the contacts admit an equilibrium (jam-LP dual residual < 1e-8, then a second pass at < 1e-7: at
   n ≈ 250–300, f64 round-off alone reaches ~1.5e-8).  If none does, the corner–corner MILP (5) is run on the input: a
   descent means "not a local minimum" (the input must be re-optimised first); otherwise "near side–side" incidences are tried (other
   corners of an already touching side within 1e-6 … 3e-3: nearly parallel sides whose angle has not converged in f64).
   A contact set whose equations are inconsistent (the projection in 4 stalls) is refused.
2. **Load-bearing set A** = max-support solution of the jam-LP dual: λ ≥ 0, Σ λ_k ∇g_k = ∇S (equilibrium with unit
   pressure), maximising the support (Goldman–Tucker: a contact is in A iff it can carry force in some equilibrium).
   Squares with no contact in A are **free** (rattlers or force-free).  It is recomputed at the exact point.
3. **KKT system.**  Unknowns: (x, y, θ) of the squares in the system, S, and λ.  Equations: g_b = 0 for an independent
   subset B of the closed contacts, and stationarity ∂S/∂v − Σ λ_b ∂g_b/∂v = 0 for every variable v.  This covers
   the rigid case (contacts fix everything, λ follows) and the under-determined case (the stationarity rows close the
   system: eliminating λ from them gives exactly David Ellsworth's nested Jacobian-determinant conditions
   [kingbird.myphotos.cc/packing/squares_in_squares__analytic_minimization.html]).  Over-determined/redundant contacts:
   B = rank-revealing QR subset (preferring large λ), the rest verified afterwards.  Exact flat directions (e.g. a square
   sliding between parallel sides) make the KKT Jacobian singular: the variable is frozen (dropped with its stationarity
   row, verified afterwards).  Force-free contacts that are closed (within tol) between squares in the system are kept
   closed too (otherwise a flat motion could open them into overlap).  Free squares that cannot be given positive
   clearance are promoted into the system.
4. **Solve.**  Minimum-norm Gauss–Newton projection onto an independent subset of the contact equations (rank-revealing
   QR; at degenerate configurations such as the (7+√7)/2 family, redundant contacts agree only to second order and
   projecting on all of them stalls at ~(input error)²; the rest are checked afterwards) (removes the f64 noise, ~1e-7 → 1e-70),
   then chord Newton on the KKT system: residuals in mpmath at `dps` digits, Jacobian (with analytic Hessians of the
   contact functions) in f64, LU per step.  Converges ~10–16 digits per step.  Free squares are then moved (iterated
   LP) to clearance ≥ 1e-6 where possible.
5. **Verification (numerical, high precision).**
   * redundant contacts and frozen stationarity rows: residual ≤ 1e-70 (dps 80);
   * every pair and wall: SAT gap in mp (active pairs ≈ 0, others reported with their minimum);
   * multipliers: LP over all λ ≥ 0 with J_Aᵀλ = e_S at the exact point: report max-min λ (> 0 ⇒ strict complementarity);
   * second order: Hessian of the Lagrangian (with that λ) on null(J_A); negative modes are tested against the critical
     cone (weakly active contacts, convex QP over zero modes) and against all valid multipliers (LP); **zero modes** are
     probed by moving 1e-3 along them and projecting back onto {g_A = 0}: an exact flat family converges with |ΔS| ≤ 1e-30;
   * first-order rigidity (squares with zero rows in null(J_A));
   * **corner–corner MILP**: min first-order dS over motions |z| ≤ 1 with every smooth contact linearised and every
     corner–corner touch as a disjunction (one binary per candidate separating line).  dS* = 0 ⇒ first-order jammed in every
     branch of the true (non-smooth) feasible set.
6. **Certificate** (`certificate`, `verify_cert.py`).  Scale the exact configuration about the origin corner by 1 + ε
   (ε = 1e-20): every gap grows by ≥ ε·(centre distance along the separating normal ≥ 1) and walls by ≥ ε/2.  Round
   centres to 10⁻³⁵ and rotations to rational t = tan(θ/2) (c, s) = ((1−t²)/(1+t²), 2t/(1+t²)), so c² + s² = 1 exactly;
   S' = S(1+ε) rounded up.  `verify_cert.py` checks with exact rationals: each square inside the open box, each pair
   with |Δc|² ≤ 2 separated by one of the 4 face normals (SAT), others by disjoint circumscribed discs.
7. **Algebraic identification** (`--algdeg D`): `mpmath.findpoly` on S (small coefficients only; see results).


   **Active-set step.**  Squares in exact flat motions can drift during the solve into a pair that was open (by more than
   the contact tolerance) at the input.  If the final SAT check finds such an overlap, that pair's incidences
   (|g| < 1e-4 at the input, both ends of a nearly parallel side contact) are added as equations and the solve is
   repeated (up to 4 times).  The multiplier LP at the exact point then decides whether the result is still a KKT point.

## What is certified exactly, and what only numerically

* **Exact (rational arithmetic, independent of the solver):** the certificate — n disjoint closed unit squares inside
  [0, S']², hence **s(n) ≤ S'**.  `verify_cert.py` is 80 lines of stdlib Python.
* **Numerical (mpmath, 80 digits; not interval arithmetic):** that S is (to ~70 digits) the value at an exact KKT
  point of the given contact structure; λ > 0; the second-order status; the flat-mode probe; the MILP jamming test
  (f64 LP/MILP at the high-precision point).  None of this is a proof of local optimality; an interval-Newton (Krawczyk)
  enclosure of the KKT root would be the next step toward a rigorous statement.
* Not addressed: global optimality, and second-order effects of corner–corner disjunctions.

All 7 certificates check VALID with `verify_cert.py`.  Known values reproduced: s(5) = 2 + 1/√2 (`--algdeg` finds
2x² − 8x + 7), s(10) = 3 + 1/√2 (2x² − 12x + 17), s(11), s(17), s(71) to all 28–30 digits given on the site.  At 300
digits `--algdeg 16` finds for s(11) the irreducible octic
**x⁸ − 20x⁷ + 178x⁶ − 842x⁵ + 1923x⁴ − 496x³ − 6754x² + 12420x − 6865**.  No polynomial of degree ≤ 16 with
small coefficients was found for s(17), s(71), rec110 or couzo110 (150–200 digits).


## Limitations

* Local optimality is numerical (f64 LP/MILP/eigenvalues at an 80-digit point), not interval-certified.  Only the
  upper bound S' is exact.  Corner–corner disjunctions are handled at first order only (no branch-wise second order).
* The contact model needs a reasonably converged input.  Contacts open by more than 1e-6, or nearly parallel sides off
  by more than 3e-3 rad, are not recognised.  A wrong guess is caught (no λ ≥ 0, inconsistent equations, SAT
  violations, MILP descent) rather than silently accepted, but then no exact KKT point is produced.  In the batch this
  happened at n = 292 (n = 105, 130 resolved 10-05 evening, below).
* Jammed only with corner–corner touches (MILP: jammed in every branch, no smooth equilibrium): every branch is then
  jammed and has an equilibrium, so exactsolve takes one branch (each touch on its best separating line) as equations
  before trying near side–side incidences.  Second-order and KKT statements are for that branch.  (Added 10-05; n = 105.)
* If Newton's Jacobian turns singular near convergence (cond > 1e13 at residual < 1e-8: the independent contact subset
  chosen at the f64 input becomes dependent at the exact point), the subset is re-chosen at the current point, up to 3
  times (`kkt_resetups` in the JSON).  (Added 10-05; n = 130.)
